implement a feature that allows users to update their account email addresses. This could involve adding a new endpoint to your server’s API for handling email updates, along with the necessary backend logic to verify and process the change securely. Additionally, you would need to update your database schema to store and manage the updated email addresses.

	1.	API Endpoint: Create a new endpoint, such as /account/email, that accepts HTTP requests for updating the user’s email address.
	2.	Validation: Implement validation logic on the server side to ensure that the new email address meets any requirements (e.g., format validation, uniqueness).
	3.	Authentication: Ensure that the user is authenticated and authorized to update their email address. This might involve verifying their identity through password re-authentication or sending a verification email to the current address.
	4.	Backend Logic: Write the backend logic to update the user’s email address in the database after validating the request. Be sure to handle any error cases gracefully and provide informative responses to the user.
	5.	Database Update: Modify your database schema to accommodate the updated email addresses. This might involve adding a new column to the user table or creating a separate table for storing email history.
	6.	Email Confirmation: Optionally, send a confirmation email to the new address to verify ownership before making the change permanent.
	7.	Error Handling: Implement error handling and logging to capture any unexpected issues that may arise during the update process.
